= Scruffy Changelog
== Version 0.2.3
(July 4th, 2008)
* Got pie charts working
* Added rough capability for legend to run vertically (better for Pie chart)
* Added some checks in the Pie initializer so that you simply pass a Hash of
  name => values, instead of adding PieSlices in a block.
* Added a simplistic unit test that outputs a pie and line chart in PNG & SVG.
* Quite a lot of hard-wired values in here. Whole thing needs a spring clean.

== Version 0.2.2
(August 19th, 2006)

* Removed all font-family and text-rendering attributes from elements.
	- These were causing issues with Batik and Adobe Viewer.  Horrible font problems.
* Added require 'builder' to renderers/base.rb
* Added minor shadows to most graph types.  Adds some depth perception.
* Added graph.layout as an alias of renderer.  (graph.layout looks nicer).
* Added markers, values, grid options.

== Version 0.2.1
(August 18th, 2006)

* Mostly documentation.
* Added Builder 2.0 dependency to gem spec.
* Removed minimum size hack in RMagickRasterizer, for now.


== Version 0.2.0
(August 14th, 2006)

- Lots of changes, hold on tight:

* Redesigned rendering system to a component-based design.
  All objects on the canvas are components that can be re-arranged via renderers.
* Created default renderer for basic Gruff-like layout.
* Added Reversed and Cubed renderers to demonstrate the customization abilities (plus, they're cool).
* Added Split renderer.
* Created Viewport component to help with Cubed.
	- Viewport lets you scale it's inner components and move around the
	  graph.  Its components' sizes and positions are relative to the viewport,
	  not the graph.
* Set title to respect marker color if available.
* Respects :to option in Graph#render for SVG output to file.
* Stacked layer type -- accepts layers which it then uses to create a stacked graph.  Such as Bar graphs
  and Area graphs.
* Abstracted out layer_container functionality to helper module (for stacked graph)
* Renamed value_transformers to value_formatters.
* Refined Value Formatters.
	- Created default: Number.
	- Respects float precision
	- Allows for "auto-precision", which will use the largest precision (up to a customizable limit)
	  necessary to portray the values correctly.  ie: 5.1, 6.32, 7.142  becomes   '5.100', '6.320', '7.142'
* Modified Legend component, Layers, and Graph component to respect categories.
	- ie:  Creating a Bar layer with :category => :sales and a Graph with :category => :qa will result in
	  the Bay layer not being displayed.  Allows for more than one Graph viewport on a screen with different
	  layers.
* Improved rasterizing at smaller sizes( < 300px) by rasterizing the image at a larger size first, then
  allowing RMagick to resize the image with specific filtering/blurring.  Actually looks better than just
  rasterizing the SVG at the small size from the beginning.
* Fixed Opacity on stacked graphs.
* Added Style (invisible) components to allow for CSS styling. (Not recommended, however.)
* Added Label component for arbitrary text.
* Created Theme object in place of theme hash.
